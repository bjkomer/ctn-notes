follow this guide:

if path stuff doesn't work, might need to find and add them
e.g. export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/home/komer/ros/vision_opencv/opencv2/
the following seems to get all of them:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/home/komer/ros

need to also add
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/komer/ratslam_ros:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH


oxford data set:
uses fish-eye camera that can see behind itself
-possibly for understanding walking clockwise vs counter-clockwise around a space
-it corrects for drift in a new path when it reaches a familiar location, really cool!
-it can have rather large errors before correction, but this seems to match with humans
-if your computer freezes, it could mess up the data -> each run through a bag file is slightly different

stlucia data set:
-the map it creates totally sucks if you set the bag file to publish at an extremely fast rate (i.e. 1000 times faster)
-video seems to lag behind the map drawing at higher speeds, but the video still moves faster than normal speed
-map drawing finishes while the video is still going
-closing roscore seems to speed up the video briefly, and then close it
-cars driving by, while not moving at a stop sign, make the algorithm think it moved slightly, because of the change in picture, even though the vehicle is still
-near the end, around 5400/5768, the experience map seems to stop changing, while the video keeps going

-when the bag file is played 10 times as fast, the map seems horribly wrong
--it moves even when the car is stopped
--it also keeps going for a bit after the bag file has stopped loading, meaning there is a delay somewhere
--near the end the video will keep playing, but the experience map will stop
--the map won't fully stop, the backpropagation will continue, and the location of the rat will move sometimes, but it will not move due to motion anymore
--computer crashed at the end of the simulation
